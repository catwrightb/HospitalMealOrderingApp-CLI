# HospitalMealOrderingApp-CLI
This application is designed to allow quicker and more efficient food ordering for hospital patients. The application offers 2 user interfaces one for nurses and another for kitchen staff. Nurses are able to not only place patients upcoming meal orders but they are also able to track previous orders as well as cost and calorie intake of patients.
